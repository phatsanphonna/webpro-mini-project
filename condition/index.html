      <p>
        Up until now, the JavaScript code you've written is executed line by line from top to bottom. But what if you
        want to run some lines of code only when a certain condition is met?
      </p>
      <p>
        A computer program usually needs to take into account many different conditions that can arise during the
        program's execution.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is similar to how a human makes decisions in their life. For example, do you have money to cover the
        vacation to Japan? If yes, go. If not, then save more money!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where control flow comes in. Control flow is a feature in a programming language that allows you to
        selectively run specific code based on the different conditions that may arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using control flows allows you to define multiple paths a program can take based on the conditions present in
        your program.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two types of control flows commonly used in JavaScript: conditionals and loops.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section will focus on the conditional statements such as:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-decimal ml-4">
        <li>
          <code>if...else</code> statement
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>switch...case</code> statement
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="text-2xl font-medium">The if...else statement</h4>
      <p>
        The <code>if</code> statement allows you to create a program that runs only if a specific condition is met.
      </p>
      <p>
        The syntax for the <code>if</code> statement is as follows:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">if (condition) {
  // code to execute if condition is true
}</code></pre>

      <p>
        Let's see an example. Suppose you want to go on a vacation that requires 5000 dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the <code>if</code> statement, here's how you check if you have enough balance:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">let balance = 7000;

if (balance > 5000) {
  console.log("You have the money for this trip. Let's go!");
}</code></pre>

      <p>
        Run the code above once, and you'll see the string printed on the terminal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now change the value of <code>balance</code> to <code>3000</code> and you'll get no response.
      </p>
      <p>
        This happens because the code inside the <code>if</code> statement is only executed when the condition is
        <code>true</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the <code>if</code> statement, you can write another line of code below it as follows:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">let balance = 7000;

if (balance > 5000) {
  console.log("You have the money for this trip. Let's go!");
}
console.log("The end!");</code></pre>

      <p>
        The second <code>console.log()</code> call above will be executed no matter what value you assign to the
        <code>balance</code> variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want it to execute only when the <code>if</code> condition is met, then put the line inside the curly
        brackets as well:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">let balance = 7000;

if (balance > 5000) {
  console.log("You have the money for this trip. Let's go!");
  console.log("The end!");
}</code></pre>

      <p>
        Next, suppose you need to run some code only when the if statement condition is not fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where the else statement comes in. The else statement is used to run code only when the if statement is
        not fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">let balance = 7000;

if (balance > 5000) {
  console.log("You have the money for this trip. Let's go!");
} else {
  console.log("Sorry, not enough money. Save more!");
}
console.log("The end!");</code></pre>

      <p>
        Now change the value of balance to be less than 5000, and you'll trigger the else block in the example.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript also has the else if statement which allows you to write another condition to check should the if
        statement condition isn't met.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the example below:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">let balance = 7000;

if (balance > 5000) {
  console.log("You have the money for this trip. Let's go!");
} else if (balance > 3000) {
  console.log("You only have enough money for a staycation");
} else {
  console.log("Sorry, not enough money. Save more!");
}
console.log("The end!");</code></pre>

      <p>
        When the <code>balance</code> amount is less than <code>5000</code>, the <code>else if</code> statement will
        check if the <code>balance</code> is more than <code>3000</code>. If
        it does, then the program will proceed to recommend you do a staycation.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can write as many <code>else if</code> statements as you need, and each one will be executed only if the
        previous
        statement isn't met.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, the <code>if..else..else if</code> statements allow you to execute different blocks of code depending
        on the
        condition the program faced.
