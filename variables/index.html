      <p>
        In programming, a variable is simply a name that you give to a value so that you can access that value later.
        You can think of a variable as a label that can be tagged to a certain value, so you can refer to the value
        using the label.
      </p>
      <p>
        To declare a variable, you need to type the keyword let followed by the variable name.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first line in the code tells JavaScript to associate the <code>message</code> variable with the value
        <code>Hello World!</code>:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">let message = "Hello World!"</code></pre>

      <p>
        In the second line, JavaScript is instructed to print the value of <code>message</code>, and that's exactly what
        it does.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can change the value of your variable by re-assigning another value as follows:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">message = "Hello World!"
print(message)
message = "Nice weather!"
print(message)</code></pre>
      <p>
        Run the file and you'll see two lines printed as the output:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-js">Hello World!
Nice weather!</code></pre>
      <p>
        Variables are used to reference data so that you can use the same data multiple times in your program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, let's see some rules for naming variables in JavaScript.
      </p>

      <h4 class="text-2xl font-medium">Variable naming</h4>
      <p>
        JavaScript has a few naming rules that you need to know to avoid naming errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variable names can only contain alphabet letters, numbers, and underscores (<code>_</code>). This means you can
        name your variable <code>message</code>, <code>message_1</code>, <code>message_2</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first character of the variable name must not be a number. <code>message_1</code> is okay.
        <code>1_message</code> is not.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can't use reserved keywords such as <code>console</code> because they are used by JavaScript to do certain
        things. There
        are many other keywords used by JavaScript that you'll learn in the following sections such as <code>if</code>,
        <code>for</code>, and
        <code>while</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variable names are case-sensitive, which means <code>Message</code>, <code>MESSAGE</code>, and
        <code>message</code> can be used to create three
        different variables. But of course, I don't recommend using similar names as it causes confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, you need more than one word to declare a variable name. JavaScript has two naming conventions that
        are used worldwide:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal ml-8">
        <li>camelCase</li>
        <li>snake_case</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Camel case is a naming convention that uses an uppercase letter for the first character for subsequent words.
        Here's an example:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">let myAwesomeVariable</code></pre>
      <p>
        The snake case naming convention uses an underscore to separate words. Here's an example:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">let my_awesome_variable</code></pre>
      <p>
        Both are acceptable naming conventions, but you should stick to one of them in your code to avoid confusion.
      </p>

      <h4 class="text-2xl font-medium">Constant Variable</h4>
      <p>
        There are times when you need to store a value that never changes in a variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        A constant variable is a variable that doesn't change its value as long as the program is running. In other
        programming languages, changing the value of a constant will produce an error.
      </p>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, a constant variable is declared using the const keyword.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following shows how to declare 2 constants in JavaScript:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">const FILE_SIZE_LIMIT = 2000
const MAX_SPEED = 300</code></pre>
      <p>
        The naming convention for a constant is to use all uppercase letters, although using lowercase letters also
        works. The uppercase is just a standard to make constants stand out more.
      </p>

      <h4 class="text-2xl font-medium">The var keyword</h4>
      <p>
        The var keyword is used to declare variables with a global scope. This keyword was the only keyword you can use
        to declare variables before JavaScript released the new let and const keyword in 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of today, you should avoid using <code>var</code> if you can, since <code>var</code> can introduce bugs that
        you can avoid by using the
        <code>let</code> keyword.
      </p>
      <p>
        To show you what I mean, consider the following example:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">if(true) {
    var name = "Nathan";
}

console.log(name)</code></pre>
      <p>
        The code above will print the name variable just fine, but it really should not because the variable name is
        declared inside the if block.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is because any variable declared using the <code>var</code> keyword is accessible from everywhere. The
        scope of that
        variable is global.
      </p>
      On the other hand, the <code>let</code> keyword has a block scope, which means the variable is only accessible
      from the block
      and all its child blocks.
      <p>
        But why bother with scoping the variable? This is because when you have hundreds or thousands of code lines, it
        can become frustrating to trace an error that occurs because of global variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a principle in software development called "principles of least exposure", which means you don't expose
        any part of your program that's unnecessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Block scoping a variable ensures that a variable is exposed and accessible only in parts of your codebase that
        require the variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        A variable declared using the <code>let</code> keyword is identical to a variable declared using
        <code>var</code> except for the scope
        level.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">if(true) {
    let name = "Nathan";
}

console.log(name)  // Error: name is not defined</code></pre>

      <p>
        This also means that you now have <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code> keywords to declare
        a variable. Which one to use?
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, you can declare a variable with <code>const</code> first. When you code your application and realize
        that you
        need to change the variable assignment, you can change the declaration to let.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you know from the start that the variable's value will change, then you can use <code>let</code> immediately.
        Just don't
        use <code>var</code> today or people might get mad at you.
